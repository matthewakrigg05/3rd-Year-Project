This is the repository containing my university final year project. 

The intention here is to create a collection of python scripts to first farm data from reddit where Donald Trump is the common topic. Then using this data, I intend 
to perform three different methods of sentiment analysis in order to compare them directly with one another. I intend to compare the TextBlob sentiment analyser,
then the VADER model which is intended to be more tailored towards social media language and interactions, and finally a GPT model to see the effect of adding
a model that can understand and interpret context.
