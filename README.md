This is the repository containing my university final year project. 

The aim of this project is to perform a comparative, and evaluative study on current sentiment analysis methods. This involves
comparing four tools: TextBlob, VADER, BERT and GPT-2. The study will weigh up the accuracy benefits against the computational
costs of these models.

Project Structure Overview:
 - EXPLORE_REQUIREMENTS: Initial exploring and testing out APIs/Libraries manually to see what will need to go into the unit tests
 - TESTING: The unit tests before development
 - src: What is developed and used as part of the projects outputs
