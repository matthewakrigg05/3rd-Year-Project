This is the repository containing my university final year project.

The aim of this project is to perform a comparative, and evaluative study on current sentiment analysis methods. This involves
comparing four tools: TextBlob, VADER, BERT and GPT-2. The study will weigh up the accuracy benefits against the computational
costs of these models.
